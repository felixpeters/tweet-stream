# Tweet-Stream

This Python module allows you to track activities of Twitter users via the
[Twitter Streaming API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview/statuses-filter).

Logged activities include:
* Any status messages of the observed user group
* All retweets (including quotes) by other users
* All replies by other users

All activities are saved to a SQLite3 database, extracting the most interesting
attributes in the process.
